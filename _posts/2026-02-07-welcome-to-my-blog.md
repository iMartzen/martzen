This is your first blog post written in Obsidian and published with Jekyll!

## Writing in Obsidian

You can write your blog posts in Obsidian using markdown. Here are some features:

- **Bold text** and *italic text*
- Lists (like this one)
- Links and images
- Code blocks
- And much more!

## How to Create New Posts

1. Open your vault in Obsidian
2. Navigate to the `_posts` folder
3. Create a new note with the format: `YYYY-MM-DD-title-of-post.md`
4. Add the front matter (the YAML section at the top)
5. Write your content in markdown
6. Save and rebuild your Jekyll site!

## Code Example

```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello from Jekyll + Obsidian!")
```

## Images

Place your images in the `assets/images` folder and reference them like this:

```markdown
![Alt text](/assets/images/your-image.jpg)
```

Happy blogging! 🎉

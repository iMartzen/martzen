This setup allows you to use Obsidian as your blog post editor while Jekyll generates your website.

## Why This Setup?

- **Obsidian**: Great markdown editor with linking, tags, and graph view
- **Jekyll**: Powerful static site generator
- **Together**: Best of both worlds!

## Workflow

Your workflow is simple:

1. Write posts in Obsidian
2. Save them in the `_posts` folder
3. Run Jekyll to build your site
4. Deploy to GitHub Pages or your hosting

## Obsidian Features You Can Use

- **Internal Links**: `[[Other Note]]` (though these need to be converted for Jekyll)
- **Tags**: Use the front matter tags
- **Templates**: Create post templates in Obsidian
- **Daily Notes**: Can be repurposed as blog posts

Enjoy your new blog! 📝
